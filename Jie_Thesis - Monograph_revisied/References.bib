  Abstract                 = {This technical report is concerned with one aspect of environmental monitoring{---}the detection and analysis of acoustic events in sound recordings of the environment. Sound recordings offer ecologists the advantage of cheaper and increased sampling but make available so much data that automated analysis becomes essential. The report describes a number of tools for automated analysis of recordings, including noise removal from spectrograms, acoustic event detection, event pattern recognition, spectral peak tracking, syntactic pattern recognition applied to call syllables, and oscillation detection. 

These algorithms are applied to a number of animal call recognition tasks, chosen because they illustrate quite different modes of analysis: (1) the detection of diffuse events caused by wind and rain, which are frequent contaminants of recordings of the terrestrial environment; (2) the detection of bird and calls; and (3) the preparation of acoustic maps for whole ecosystem analysis. This last task utilises the temporal distribution of events over a daily, monthly or yearly cycle.

studies. In this study, a novel feature extraction method for frog call
classification is presented based on the analysis of spectrograms. The frog
calls are first automatically segmented into syllables. Then, spectral peak
tracks are extracted to separate desired signal (frog calls) from
background noise. The spectral peak tracks are used to extract various
syllable features, including: syllable duration, dominant frequency,
oscillation rate, frequency modulation, and energy modulation. Finally, a
k-nearest neighbor classifier is used for classifying frog calls based on
the results of principal component analysis. The experiment results show
that syllable features can achieve an average classification accuracy of
90.5\% which outperforms Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients features
(79.0\%).},
