\begin{abstract}
Rapid decreases in frog populations have been spotted from locations over the world, which are regarded as one of the most critical threats to the global biodiversity. Causes of these declines can be summarised as follows: disease, habitat destruction and modification, exploitation, pollution, pesticide use, introduced species, and ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B). On the one hand frog populations are declining globally, but on the other frogs play an important role in the whole ecosystem. To assess frog populations and optimise the protection policy, monitoring frogs is becoming ever more necessary. Since frogs are much easier to be heard than seen, frog populations are often assessed by their vocalisations. In order to collect frogs' vocalisations, traditional manual methods require ecologists and volunteers to visit the field, which limits the        
scale for acoustic data collection. In contrast, recent advances in acoustic sensors provide us a novel method to survey vocalising animals such as frogs. 
Deploying acoustic sensors in the field, they can then automatically collect large volumes of acoustic data at large spatial and temporal scales. After the data is collected by sensors, the raw audio data must be analysed to provide interpretable results. Due to the amount of collected data, enabling automating species identification in acoustic data has become important. Also since the data is collected from the field, the acoustic data tend to be very noisy. Very often the desired signal (frog call) is weak and there are multiple overlapping signals over the frog call. These characteristics pose a big challenge to perform the classification of frog species in acoustic data.



The research presented in this dissertation aims to investigate methods to build a robust and high performance classification system for frog species in acoustic data. By considering the influences for a classification system, two aspects are investigated: feature extraction and classification, which consist of contributions towards three main objectives:
\begin{enumerate} 
\item[(1)]	Develop an enhanced feature representation for frog call classification. Classifying frog calls based on the enhanced temporal, perceptual and cepstral features is proposed. Time-frequency information of frog calls can be effectively represented via the enhanced feature representation. Classification performance of various machine learning techniques is compared with different feature representations. Our proposed enhanced feature representation achieves the best classification accuracy which outperforms the state-of-the-art.
 
\item[(2)]	Propose a novel feature representation based on adaptive wavelet packet decomposition. To better capture the frequency domain information of frog calls with a good anti-noise ability, a novel feature representation is proposed named \textit{adaptive frequency scaled wavelet packet decomposition sub-band cepstral coefficients}. Compared with other cepstral coefficients, our proposed feature representation shows the best classification performance and a good anti-noise ability.

\item[(3)]	Design a robust classification system to study low SNR recordings with multiple simultaneously vocalising frog species. Two classification frameworks are employed to classify multiple simultaneously vocalising frog species. 




\begin{enumerate}
\item Multiple-instance Multiple-label (MIML) learning
\\
To use MIML learning for classifying multiple simultaneously vocalising frog species, each individual syllables are first segmented. Then, various features are calculated from each segmented syllable. Next, a bag generator is applied to those extracted features to construct a suitable bag-of-syllable representation. Finally, three MIML learning algorithms are employed for the classification of frog vocalisations: MIML-SVM, MIML-KNN, and MIML-RBF. 

\item Multiple-label (ML) learning
\\
As for the ML learning, acoustic features are first calculated without segmentation. Then, ML learning is used to classify simultaneously vocalising frog species using extracted features. Three main ML learning methods are compared: Binary relevance, Classifier Chains, Random k-labelsets, where the base classifier is decision tree. Furthermore, the frog abundance and species richness over three months are calculated based on the results acoustic event detection and ML classification, respectively. 
Lastly, the correlation analysis between frog calling activity (frog abundance and species richness) and weather variables (mean temperature and rainfall) are studied.
\end{enumerate}


\end{enumerate} 


Our proposed approach achieves promising classification results compared to the state-of-the-art. Novel feature representations and classification learning frameworks have different contributions to the performance of the classification system of frog vocalisations. To our knowledge so far, it is the first time that MIML learning and ML learning are employed for automatic classification of multiple simultaneously vocalising frog species.
